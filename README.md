# OVERVIEW

This template was made as a guide to ensure you cover assessment criteria in your fourth portfolio write up. It is specific to the **PORTFOLIO 4: Full-Stack Toolkit** project. 

## Helpful tools

Markdown's not all that easy so sometimes you may want to use some tools to make tables. 

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) - used to help with documentation table formatting
- [mardown table of contents generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
- [readme.so](https://readme.so/) - if you don't want to learn markdown, this tool might help you

# Table of Contents
Copy your readme to http://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/ to make a table of contents.  This will help assessors to see the structure of your readme. Just test it out ast this tool isn't perfect. It tends to mess up with special characters like dashes.

## Project Overview

This project was incepted with the goal of creating a 'hassle-free' booking system for a Diner to increase their revenue. It achieves this goal by means of two models; a "user", and a "booking" system.
The user can very easily sign-up for an account, which only then grants them access to the booking form. Users are also allowed the freedom to view, edit, and cancel their bookings as well as their own personal accounts with the Diner if they wish to do so, following the C.R.U.D. Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

The app also aims to reflect the diner itself in its color pallette and vintage feel, friendly and straight out of the 70s.

You can view this web application [here](https://ceru-restaurant.herokuapp.com/).

### Colors

Below you can find the colors chosen for this web application.
- #0C5679 Blue Sapphire
- #FFE7BD Peach
- #E5340B Vermilion
- #F28A0F Tangerine
<img width="1150" alt="color-palette" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82375381/157326869-4be966f8-7250-4436-9a49-a7f4e35db8ba.png">

Below you can find the inspiration for the colors chosen for this web application.
<img width="338" alt="color-palette-inspiration" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82375381/157326981-784b9502-2381-435a-b9b8-2a33d2bae8dc.png">

I chose these colors and inspiration based on the decade the Diner was built, the 1970s. The inspiration was taken from a popular home wallpaper pattern and color chosen by families in the United States. These colors are nostalgic and retro, which impacts the target audience, whom would ideally be interested, or have grown up in The Golden Era of the United States.

### Typography

- discuss font size, font types for headers vs buttons vs general text and how it ties into users' emotions or target audience.
- include screenshots of fonts used and links to the appropriate website ex) https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

### Images

Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site

### Design Elements

- list out the type of elements you want to use on your site, this will help you  when choosing a framework and goes hand in hand when doing the wireframes. If you did something out of the ordinary, or think something was particularly clever, add a sentence and a screenshot or reference the file the code or css is in.

### Animations and Transitions

- discuss any special animations or transitions you've programmed 
- special hover state effects


### Custom Styles
- call out any overrides you did for bootstrap styles or the framework you used,  even if they are fonts and colors, perhaps lead assessors to the file of interest in your repo 

### Custom Javascript

Minimal JavaScript was used for this project. All of the JavaScript code written can be found at "static/js/script.js" and it was implemented on the template files "booking-form.html", and "edit-booking-form.html" to ensure the browser does not allow the user to select a date in the past, only from today onwards.

Below you can find a snippet of the JavaScript code used.

### User Stories

I followed Agile process and used GitHub issues to store my User Stories. They were created from the Epics above and were prioritized and ordered from "Must have", and "Should have", to "Could have", according to the Agile Process taught in one of the Code Institute lessons.

You can view my User Stories [here](https://github.com/gabriel-alves-p/ceru-restaurant/projects/1) or by clicking on 'Projects' and then 'User Stories' on this repository on GitHub.

All of my templates (User Stories and Bug Report) can be viewed [here](https://github.com/gabriel-alves-p/ceru-restaurant/issues/new/choose) or by clicking on 'Issues' and then 'New Issue' on this repository on GitHub.

# Information Architecture
As part of the requirements for this project you need to have at least 1 original data model.  It's this section that discusses your data and how each piece relates to another and draws out the CRUD functionality you built. 

## Entity Relationship Diagram
Wade Williams wrote a great blog about how to add a django extension to auto create an ERD. https://wadewilliams.com/technology-software/generating-erd-for-django-applications/ You can always draw one out by hand or google sheets. You can also draw this up by hand if you want or use a spreadsheet to show your data model. 

## Database Choice

PostgreSQL was my database of choice for the deployed application, for the data is relational and Heroku (used for deployment) serves this up realitvely easily, and with no cost.

## Data Models
Show the accessors you know your data. If you end up using some data models from an example project, call that out and don't be as detailed about writing those up unless you added to them.  

Each data model that you created yourself should have its Fields, Field Type and any validation documented.  You should also cross-reference any code in your repository that relate to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE operations for these models. 

Below is an example of a write up for an Activies Data Model
### Activities Model
Activities is a table to hold a unique icon image and name values that users have associated with events and places. It helps with sorting events and prevents the need from carrying around two data objects in the larger Events and Places data structures. The purpose of an Activities object is to provide an imagery association to a category.

| DB Key 	| Data Type 	|          Purpose          	| Form Validation                        	| DB processing    	|
|--------	|:---------:	|:-------------------------:	|----------------------------------------	|------------------	|
| _id    	| ObjectId  	| unique identifier         	| None                                   	| n/a              	|
| name   	| String    	| Name of Activity          	| Required<br>Min 1 char<br>Max 50 chars 	| trim<br>to lower 	|
| icon   	| String    	| system path to image file 	| Required                               	|                  	|

Activity entries are used by events, places and filtering.

- [x] Create - An activity is potentially created when a user successfully creates a place, creates an event, updates an event, or updates a place. 
- [x] Read - The Activities table is read when a user is adding an event, updating an event, adding a place or updating a place, to determine if a new value should be created or not. The activities table is queried for using the name and icon pair, if it is found, the ObjectId is passed to the event and places. If no match is found, a new Activity is created and that ObjectID is passed to the the place or event.
- [ ] Update
- [ ] Delete
 
 This table has no deletion or updates associated with it. It's strictly create and read. Eventually, maintenance scripts should be written to delete unused/deprecated entries.

The reading/writing of the activities table is housed in the [what2do2day/activities/views.py](what2do2day/activities/views.py) file.

### CRUD Diagrams
This is if you want to go for distinction.  You can also have CRUD diagrams to show them visually how the model is used in your site. 

I used [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and hooked it up to my google drive to create the screenshot below

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/154406188-c9beb57a-2fd1-4f26-a8ed-bee320e46e3d.png)


# Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so and how they tie into  your user stories.

## Implemented Features

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

It's easiest to break this section down into the header, footer, and each page/layer of your website. Call out any differences for mobile vs desktop presentations, **include a screenshot of the implemented feature** and **at least 2 bullet points of their importance**.

Don't forget your 404 error page.

## Future Features

Use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

If you end up not developing some features you hoped to implement, you can include those in this section.

# Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Validation Testing
You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Note, any error associated with root: color variables were ignored.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) NOTE: You may need to view the source of each page and paste that into the validator
- [JS validation](https://jshint.com) for each .js file/ , if using ES6, add this before pasting in your file: `/*jshint esversion: 6 */ `
- [JSON validation](https://jsonlint.com/) for each .json file 
- [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/) include a screenshot of results. (you should do this for all .py files in your repo, or note that there are no red errors in gitpod after the file is saved)

## Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

| TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | OS         | SCREEN WIDTH  |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| real phone: motog6            | chrome      | android    | XS 360 x 640  |
| browser stack: iPhone5s       | safari      | iOs        | XS 320 x 568  |
| dev tools emulator: pixel 2   | firefox     | android    | SM 411 x 731  |
| browserstack: iPhone 10x      | Chrome      | iOs        | SM 375 x 812  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - vert  | Chrome      | android    | M 600 x 960   |
| real tablet: ipad mini - vert | safari      | iOs        | M 768 x 1024  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - horiz | firefox     | android    | LG 960 x 600  |
| chrome emulator: ipad - horiz | safari      | iOs        | LG 1024 x 768 |
| browserstack                  | Chrome      | windows    | XL 1920 x 946 |
| real computer: mac book pro   | safari 12.1 | Mohave     | XL 1400 x 766 |
| browserstack                  | IE Edge 88  | windows 10 | XL 1920 x 964 |

## Manual Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. 

At this point you really should be using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it helps you with the AGILE process requirement.

Create Custom Issue Template and a milestone in git hub.[Here's a brief overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit?usp=sharing) I put together on how to do this.

## Automated Testing
If you managed to write jasmine tests or some django tests, note those files out here and how to run them.  I only did this in my last project as I didn't have the time or energy to learn how to write tests. https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ms4_challenger/blob/master/documentation/TESTING.md is my write up about those and how I ran them, but a simple test I'd recommend is authentication and any views you limit to superusers or logged in users

https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ms4_challenger/blob/master/challenges/tests/test_views.py 

## Defects of Note

I kept track of my bugs in real time. You can view them and their details [here](https://github.com/gabriel-alves-p/ceru-restaurant/projects/2) or by clicking on the 'Projects' and then 'Bug Report' on this repository on GitHub.
